## Introduction
I created a fictitious dating app using React Native, aiming to deepen my understanding of the framework's functionalities and structures. The project was inspired by the tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9XbqVbzET8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9XbqVbzET8), and I focused on building the frontend side of the application.

## Features
- Utilizes React Navigation, incorporating a stack navigator and a bottom tab navigator with Ionicons for tab icons.
- Features a Card Component with a carousel for user profiles, displaying details like name, age, city, and country.
- Implements a Chat list with user avatars and additional details.
- Displays a horizontal scroll view for the chat screen, showcasing user matches.
- Message list includes dynamic styling based on the sender, enhancing visual distinction.
- Leverages the datesData constant for mock data.
